# Netty Two Way TCP Client Server
Sample code, on how to use Netty to build a simple TCP Server/Client, Exchanging string messages.
Since I don't find a simple example on the internet, 
and to practice using Netty, i have this code snippet. Feel free to modify and reuse.

I had a lot of help from Atomix guys !
